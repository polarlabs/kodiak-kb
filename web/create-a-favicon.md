Today Favicons (favorite Icons) are used in multiple ways:

1. In the browser.
2. In search engines' results.
3. As App Icon on mobile devices.

These use cases come with different requirements towards the Favicon. Even with such 
simple things like a Favicon, one-size-fits-all just does not work. 

Fortunately there are tools available to create various favicons and 
HTML code required to use them.

The most powerful tool is [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

Btw, there is also a [Favicon Checker](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker) available.

To create a Favicon package, we need to submit an image (PNG, JPG, SVG...) with a size of 
260 x 260 at least for optimal results.
