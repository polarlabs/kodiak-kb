With Generative AI generally available, I thought creating a logo would be a breeze. 
However, it was not that easy.

I had a clear vision of how the logo should look like:

1. Silhouette of a bear's head and shoulder.
2. Perspective is a side view.
3. Head should look to the right.
4. The right front paw should be clearly recognizable. 
5. Head should look down sightly.

Additional requirements:

1. Logo should be invertible.
2. Logo should support an transparent and non transparent background.
3. Logo should be scalable to very small as well as large sizes.

I did some research on the web and evaluated some Generative AI services. However, most of them 
are not fit to create a logo plus the complementing marketing material.

The most promising service to create a logo using Generative AI 
was [MakeLogo.ai](https://makelogo.ai). And in fact it helped with finding and 
exploring potential concepts. However, it failed to create a logo as it did not 
generate only front views of bears. The thing is, that you pay before you get 
to the drafts.

# Input from MakeLogo.ai

### Core Idea

Side view of a bear's head with straight lines, emphasizing its muscular 
structure and solidity. The clean design evokes a sense of stability and force, 
reflecting the project's commitment to strength and dominance.

### Story

The logo concept is inspired by the powerful and majestic nature of bears. 
In many cultures, bears symbolize strength, courage, and protection. 
The side view of the bear's head represents a sense of determination, 
resilience, and focus. The logo captures the essence of these qualities, 
reflecting the strong character of the project.

### Vibe

Strong, powerful, and determined

# Final result from Logopony

Based on the concept, we used [Logopony](https://www.logopony.com/) to create the logo. Logopony 
also uses Generative AI, however, the approach is easier to follow compared to MakeLogo.ai. 
Users set a project name, select an icon and choose a color theme. Then, Logopony generates 
proposals for the logo.

While MakeLogo.ai generates the icons, Logopony has thousands of them available. None of it 
matched exactly what I was looking for. Anyway, I liked one of the proposals.

The good thing about Logopony is, that you pay for the result only if you like it.

# Conclusion

The result is not perfect but good enough to get started. Eventually I'll find another AI service 
or human designer to create what is on my mind for Kodiak.
